**Additional Features**

Enhanced Filtering and Pagination

    Web Application:
        Implemented task filtering by status and category using query parameters.
        Added pagination to the task list view.
    API:
        Added filtering capabilities to the GET /api/tasks endpoint for status and category.
        Implemented pagination for the task list endpoint.
    Shared:
        Created a trait to share filtering logic between web and API controllers.

Dashboard and Statistics

    Web Application:
        Created a dashboard displaying task statistics, including counts of tasks by status.
    API:
        Added an endpoint to retrieve task statistics: GET /api/tasks/stats.
    Shared:
        Extended TaskService to include a method for generating task statistics.
    Caching:
        Implemented caching for task statistics using Laravel's cache system with a reasonable expiration time.

Background Job Processing

    Created a queued job to archive completed tasks older than 30 days.
    Scheduled this job to run daily using Laravel's task scheduler.

Localization

    Added basic localization support for English and Spanish for the web interface.
    Translated navigation items, form labels, and task status names.

    Faced challenges with ensuring accurate translations across the application and resolved them by using Laravelâ€™s built-in localization features and double-checking translations.

Additional Testing

    Wrote tests for the new filtering functionality in both web and API interfaces.
    Created tests for the caching mechanism of task statistics.
    Wrote a test for the queued job that archives old tasks.
